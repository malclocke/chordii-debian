{start_of_chorus}
Swing [D]low, sweet [G]chari[D]ot,
Comin' for to carry me [A7]home.
Swing [D7]low, sweet [G]chari[D]ot,
Comin' for to [A7]carry me [D]home.
{end_of_chorus}


I looked over Jordan, and what did I see,
     Comin' for to carry me home.
A band of angels comin' after me,
     Comin' for to carry me home.

{c:Chorus}

If you get there before I do,
     Comin' for to carry me home.
Just tell my friends that I'm a comin' too.
     Comin' for to carry me home.

{c:Chorus}

I'm sometimes up and sometimes down,
     Comin' for to carry me home.
But still my soul feels heavenly bound.
     Comin' for to carry me home.

{c:Chorus}
